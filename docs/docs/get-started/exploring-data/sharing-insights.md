# Share insights with your team

It's time to share your hard work with the world!

In Lightdash there are three primary ways to share insights with your team:

* Share a URL to a 'work-in-progress' data exploration
* Share a link to a saved chart
* Download results as a .csv or a .png of the chart

## 1. Share a URL to work in progress

As you explore your data in Lightdash, the URL contains a unique link to your work in progress.

Copy and paste the url while you're exploring data and anybody with access to your Lightdash project can jump into 
an explore at exactly the same point you're at.

## 2. Share a link to a saved chart

### Save your chart

You can create a new saved chart or update an existing saved chart by clicking on the three dots beside `refresh dbt`.

### Share your chart

Everyone in your project has access to the saved charts. All they need to do is click on `saved charts` and they can 
see your finished work of chart art ðŸ˜šðŸ‘Œ

## 3. Download results as a table or chart
