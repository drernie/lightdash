# Share insights with your team

What use is your perfectly crafted data visualisation if nobody looks at it?!

In Lightdash there are three primary ways to share insights with your team:

* Share a URL to a 'work-in-progress' data exploration
* Share a link to a saved chart
* Download results as a .csv or a .png of the chart

## 1. Share a URL to work in progress

As you explore your data in Lightdash, the URL contains a unique link to your work in progress.

Copy and paste the url while you're exploring data and anybody with access to your Lightdash project can jump into 
an explore at exactly the same point you're at.

## 2. Share a link to a saved chart

Alternatively, you can use a saved chart to share a finished version of your chart. Remember charts always load with 
the most recent data, so your team mates will always see your saved chart with the latest results.

## 3. Download results as a table or chart
