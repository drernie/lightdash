# Lightdash approach to BI

The vision for Lightdash is:

> To enable everybody in your company to answer their own questions using data.

Lightdash is where data analysts (the builders) and the rest of the business (the consumers)
come together to make better data-driven decisions.

There three approaches to enabling data consumers to answer their own questions:

1. Data consumers use SQL to analyse the raw data themselves.
2. Data analysts use SQL to analyse raw data on behalf of data consumers.

**The Lightdash way**
3. Data analysts use SQL to create metrics. Data consumers use metrics to analyse data themselves.

## 1. Data consumers use SQL

Pros: flexibility, anyone can query any data

Cons: everybody has to know sql, everybody needs context of raw data

## 2. Data analysts use SQL

Pros: only analysts have to know sql

Cons: doesn't scale, analysts become a bottleneck

## Writing dimensions and metrics

Pros: only analysts have to know sql, anyone can query data

Cons: analysts have to define metrics
