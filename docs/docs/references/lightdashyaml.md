# Lightdash.yml

A `lightdash.yml` is necessary to launch Lightdash. For most projects, the
default supplied `lightdash.yml` (used automatically) is just fine.

A `lightdash.yml` file can only contain one project.

Here are two examples of valid `lightdash.yml` files for each of the three project types:
```yaml
version: '1.0'

projects:
  - type: 'dbt'
    name: myproject
    project_dir: /path/to/your/dbt/project
    profiles_dir: /path/to/your/dbt/profiles
    rpc_server_port: 8580
    target: dev # [Optional] Defaults to dbt profile target
```

```yaml
version: '1.0'

projects:
  - type: 'dbt_cloud_ide'
    name: mycloudproject
    account_id: '11111'
    environment_id: '22222'
    project_id: '33333'
    api_key: 'axx1xxbxx2xx'
```

```yaml
version: '1.0'
           
projects:
  - type: 'github'
    name: mygithubproject
    repository: lightdash/my-dbt-project
    personal_access_token: xxxxx
    branch: main
    project_sub_path: /
    profiles_sub_path: /profiles
    rpc_server_port: 8580
    target: dev # [Optional] Defaults to dbt profile target
}
```

## Environment variables

You can override any project config item using environment variables. 

The pattern for the environment variable name is: `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT_0_{key}` where
`{key}` is the name of the project variable in all upper case.

For example:

1. Update the `project_dir` of the first project: `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT_0_PROJECT_DIR`
2. Update the `rpc_server_host` of the second project: `LIGHTDASH_PROJECT_0_RPC_SERVER_HOST`

**Environment variables always take precedence over values in the `lightdash.yml` file**
